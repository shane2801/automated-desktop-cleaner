# Automated Folder Organizer
## Overview
This script provides an automated solution to organize files within a specified folder, particularly aimed at organizing the Downloads folder on Windows (or any folder). The script categorizes files based on their extensions into designated folders, helping maintain a tidy and well-organized directory structure.

## How It Works
Upon detecting changes within the specified source folder (e.g., Downloads folder), the script scans newly added or modified files and moves them to respective destination folders based on their file extensions. Files are categorized into folders such as images, documents, videos, audio, and special effects (SFX).

## Features
Automatic Organization: The script continuously monitors the source folder for any changes and organizes files accordingly.
Customizable Categories: Files are grouped into predefined categories based on their file extensions, with the ability to customize folder paths and supported file types.
Handling Duplicates: If a file with the same name already exists in the destination folder, the script ensures that the filename is unique by appending a numerical suffix.
Logging: The script logs its activities, providing visibility into the files that have been moved and their respective categories.

## Supported File Types (Can be expanded)
- **Images:** JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, etc.
- **Documents:** PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, etc.
- **Videos:** MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, etc.
- **Audio:** MP3, WAV, FLAC, AAC, etc.

## Installation and Configuration
1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required dependencies using pip(or pip3) install watchdog
3. **Configuration:** Customize the script by specifying the source folder (source_dir) and create the destination folders (dest_dir_*) for different file types. Adjust the supported file extensions according to your requirements.
4. *Run the Script:* Execute the script (python main.py) to start organizing files within the specified source folder.

## Usage
- **Start Monitoring:** Run the script and let it continuously monitor the source folder for any changes.
Observe Organization: As files are added or modified within the source folder, observe how the script automatically categorizes and moves them to the appropriate destination folders.
- **Check Logs:** Review the logs generated by the script to track the files that have been organized and their corresponding categories.
